## 🚀 About Me

I design and build **agentic security systems** that move organizations beyond dashboards, PDFs, and manual triage toward **autonomous, API-driven security operations**.

My work focuses on **AI-enabled security workflows** where raw telemetry — vulnerability scans, logs, cloud signals, and compliance evidence — is:

* **Normalized**
* **Reasoned over**
* **Prioritized**
* **Explained**
* **Acted on automatically**

My foundation in **cybersecurity, cloud, and data engineering** allows me to build systems that are:

* **Programmatic by default**
* **Auditable and governed**
* **Cost-aware and scalable**
* **Designed for AI agents — not dashboards**

**My edge:**
I don’t just detect risk — I design systems that **understand, prioritize, and explain risk** in ways both humans *and machines* can act on.

## 🧠 How I Think: Agentic & Security-First Engineering

I approach security engineering the same way modern AI systems operate:

* 🔁 **API-first ingestion** (no UI dependency)
* 🧠 **Strict schemas agents can reason over**
* 🎯 **Exposure & persistence over noise**
* 🔐 **Identity-first, least-privilege design**
* 📉 **Cost-aware and scalable pipelines**
* 🛡️ **OWASP AI Top 10 mapped directly to ML & agent workflows**

Security should **not** rely on:

* Manual exports
* Static dashboards
* One-off reports

> **Goal:** Build **self-directing security systems** that continuously assess risk, compliance, and exposure — and recommend or execute action.

## 🧱 What I Build

* ✅ Agentic vulnerability management platforms
* ✅ Agentic GRC & compliance automation systems
* ✅ API-driven security ingestion pipelines
* ✅ JSON-first security & evidence schemas
* ✅ Autonomous risk & compliance reasoning logic
* ✅ AI agents that explain *why* something matters — not just *that* it exists

I specialize in **bridging traditional security tooling with modern AI systems**.
