# 👋 Hi, I’m Albert Glenn

🤖 **AI Security Engineering** | 🔐 Agentic Defense & Vulnerability Automation | ☁️ Cloud & Identity Security | 📊 Data-Informed Risk Decisions

## 🚀 About Me

I build **agentic security systems** that move organizations beyond dashboards, PDFs, and manual triage  toward **autonomous, API-driven security operations**.

My foundation in **cybersecurity, cloud, and data engineering** allows me to design security systems that are:

* **Programmatic by default**
* **Auditable and governed**
* **Cost-aware and scalable**
* **Designed for AI agents, not humans-in-the-loop**

I focus on **AI-enabled security workflows** where raw telemetry (vulnerability scans, logs, cloud signals) is **normalized, reasoned over, and acted on automatically** — reducing analyst toil and improving response speed.

**My edge:** I don’t just detect risk, I design systems that **understand, prioritize, and explain risk** in ways both humans *and* machines can act on.

## 🧠 How I Think: Agentic & Security-First Engineering

I approach security engineering the same way modern AI systems operate:

* 🔁 **Ingest everything via APIs** (no UI dependency)
* 🧠 **Normalize signals into schemas agents can reason over**
* 🎯 **Prioritize risk, not noise**
* 🔐 **Enforce least privilege, identity-first access**
* 📉 **Design for cost control and operational efficiency**

Security should not rely on:

* Manual exports
* Static dashboards
* One-off reports

> **Goal:** Build **self-directing security systems** that continuously assess risk and recommend (or execute) action.

## 🧱 What I Build

✅ Agentic vulnerability management systems
✅ API-driven security ingestion pipelines
✅ JSON-first security schemas (not PDFs)
✅ Autonomous risk prioritization logic
✅ Identity-aware, cloud-native security workflows
✅ AI agents that explain *why* something matters — not just *that* it exists

I specialize in **bridging traditional security tools with modern AI workflows**.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🤖 Agentic Vulnerability Management System (Tenable + AI)

**Repo:**
👉 *agentic-vulnerability-management-agent* (this repo)

**What it is:**
A fully **API-driven vulnerability management pipeline** that:

1. Pulls authenticated & unauthenticated Tenable scans
2. Exports findings programmatically (JSON)
3. Normalizes vulnerabilities into a structured schema
4. Feeds them into an **AI agent** for:

   * Risk prioritization
   * Contextual explanation
   * Remediation guidance

**Why it matters:**
This project demonstrates how **traditional VM tooling can be transformed into an autonomous security system**, removing reliance on dashboards and static reports.

> PDFs are dead.
> Agents decide now.

### 🔐 Cloud & Identity Security Troubleshooting (IAM + Databricks)

**Repo:**
👉 [https://github.com/albe290/healthcare-data-engineering-troubleshooting](https://github.com/albe290/healthcare-data-engineering-troubleshooting)

**Why it still matters:**
Identity failures are **security failures**. This project shows real-world debugging of IAM trust relationships, permissions, and misconfigurations — skills directly transferable to securing AI pipelines and cloud-native security systems.

### ❤️ ML Foundations for Security Reasoning

**Repo:**
👉 [https://github.com/albe290/Heart-Disease-Prediction](https://github.com/albe290/Heart-Disease-Prediction)

**Why it’s relevant:**
Demonstrates the ML foundations required to reason about classification, thresholds, false positives, and risk scoring — all core concepts in AI-powered security.
