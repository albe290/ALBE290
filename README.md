# 👋 Hi, I'm Albert Glenn

🎯 Transitioning into **Data Engineering + AI/ML** | 🧠 System Builder | 💻 Lifelong Learner | 🚀 Building Real-World Data & ML Pipelines

## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently transitioning into the **Data Engineering and AI/Machine Learning** space after a strong foundation in technology and cybersecurity. I’m focused on building **end-to-end data and ML systems** that are production-ready, cloud-native, and aligned with real-world business needs in healthcare, finance, and media.

I’m enrolled in the **Zero to Mastery Data Engineering and AI/ML Career Paths**, and actively applying what I learn through hands-on projects.

## 🔁 Career Pivot: Data Engineering + ML Synergy

I'm not just learning how to train models — I’m building the infrastructure to support them:

- 🏗️ Designing secure database environments (PostgreSQL, RBAC, .env)
- 🔁 Building real-time pipelines with **Kafka + Spark + S3**
- 🧠 Training and deploying ML models using **TensorFlow, CatBoost, and Scikit-learn**
- 📊 Querying with **Athena**, modeling OLAP systems, and visualizing results in **Power BI**

My goal is to be the kind of engineer who understands the full lifecycle — from raw data ingestion to intelligent prediction.
