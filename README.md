## 🚀 About Me

I design and build **agentic security systems** that move organizations beyond dashboards, PDFs, and manual triage toward **autonomous, API-driven security operations**.

My work focuses on **AI-enabled security workflows** where raw telemetry — vulnerability scans, logs, cloud signals, and compliance evidence — is:

* **Normalized**
* **Reasoned over**
* **Prioritized**
* **Explained**
* **Acted on automatically**

My foundation in **cybersecurity, cloud, and data engineering** allows me to build systems that are:

* **Programmatic by default**
* **Auditable and governed**
* **Cost-aware and scalable**
* **Designed for AI agents — not dashboards**

**My edge:**
I don’t just detect risk I design systems that **understand, prioritize, and explain risk** in ways both humans *and machines* can act on.

## 🧠 How I Think: Agentic & Security-First Engineering

I approach security engineering the same way modern AI systems operate:

* 🔁 **API-first ingestion** (no UI dependency)
* 🧠 **Strict schemas agents can reason over**
* 🎯 **Exposure & persistence over noise**
* 🔐 **Identity-first, least-privilege design**
* 📉 **Cost-aware and scalable pipelines**
* 🛡️ **OWASP AI Top 10 mapped directly to ML & agent workflows**

Security should **not** rely on:

* Manual exports
* Static dashboards
* One-off reports

> **Goal:** Build **self-directing security systems** that continuously assess risk, compliance, and exposure — and recommend or execute action.

## 🧱 What I Build

* ✅ Agentic vulnerability management platforms
* ✅ Agentic GRC & compliance automation systems
* ✅ API-driven security ingestion pipelines
* ✅ JSON-first security & evidence schemas
* ✅ Autonomous risk & compliance reasoning logic
* ✅ AI agents that explain *why* something matters — not just *that* it exists

I specialize in **bridging traditional security tooling with modern AI systems**.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🛡️ **Agentic Vulnerability Management System**

**(Tenable + Exposure-Aware Risk Reasoning)**

🔗 **Repo:**
👉 [https://github.com/albe290/agentic-vulnerability-management-agent](https://github.com/albe290/agentic-vulnerability-management-agent)

**What it is:**
A **production-grade, API-driven vulnerability management platform** that transforms traditional scanning into an **autonomous risk-reasoning system**.

**What it does:**

1. Ingests **baseline, authenticated, and unauthenticated Tenable scans**
2. Normalizes findings into **canonical, asset-aware schemas**
3. Correlates scan perspectives to determine:

   * External exposure
   * Persistence across scans
   * Misconfiguration-driven risk
4. Applies **agentic reasoning logic** to:

   * Prioritize remediation
   * Generate executive-ready summaries
   * Eliminate CVSS-only decision-making

**Why it matters:**
This project shows how **traditional VM tooling becomes intelligent infrastructure** when paired with agentic reasoning.

> Dashboards are optional.
> PDFs are dead.
> **Agents decide now.**

### 🧾 **Agentic GRC & Compliance Automation Platform**

**(Evidence-Driven | Control-Mapped | Audit-Ready)**

🔗 **Repo:**
👉 [https://github.com/albe290/agentic-vulnerability-management-grc-platform](https://github.com/albe290/agentic-vulnerability-management-grc-platform)

**What it is:**
An **agentic GRC platform** that treats governance, risk, and compliance as a **machine-reasoning problem**, not a spreadsheet exercise.

**What it does:**

* Ingests **technical security evidence** directly from systems
* Normalizes artifacts into **structured GRC evidence schemas**
* Maps findings to **security controls** (e.g., NIST-style logic)
* Reasons over:

  * Control effectiveness
  * Evidence completeness
  * Risk posture
* Produces **audit-ready, explainable outputs**

**Why it matters:**
This replaces manual GRC workflows with **continuous, system-verified compliance**, enabling security and audit teams to reason about risk in real time.

---

### 🔐 **Cloud & Identity Security Troubleshooting (IAM + Databricks)**

🔗 **Repo:**
👉 [https://github.com/albe290/healthcare-data-engineering-troubleshooting](https://github.com/albe290/healthcare-data-engineering-troubleshooting)

**Why it matters:**
Identity failures are **security failures**.
This project demonstrates real-world troubleshooting of IAM trust relationships, permissions, and misconfigurations — skills directly transferable to **securing AI pipelines and agent-based systems**.

---

### ❤️ **Security-Hardened Machine Learning (OWASP AI Top 10)**

🔗 **Repo:**
👉 [https://github.com/albe290/Heart-Disease-Prediction](https://github.com/albe290/Heart-Disease-Prediction)

**What it is:**
A **security-hardened ML system** built in a healthcare context and explicitly aligned to the **OWASP AI Top 10**.

**What it demonstrates:**

* A01 — Training data integrity & poisoning safeguards
* A03 — Domain-aware input validation
* A04 — Automation bias mitigation
* A05 — Model transparency & auditability

**Why it matters:**
This shows how ML systems can be treated as **security-critical infrastructure**, not just predictive models.
