## 🚀 About Me

I design and build **agentic security systems** that move organizations beyond dashboards, PDFs, and manual triage toward **autonomous, API-driven security operations**.

My work focuses on **AI-enabled security workflows** where raw telemetry — vulnerability scans, logs, cloud signals  is **normalized, reasoned over, and acted on automatically**, reducing analyst toil and improving response speed.

My foundation in **cybersecurity, cloud, and data engineering** allows me to build security systems that are:

* **Programmatic by default**
* **Auditable and governed**
* **Cost-aware and scalable**
* **Designed for AI agents, not humans-in-the-loop**

**My edge:**
I don’t just detect risk I design systems that **understand, prioritize, and explain risk** in ways both humans *and* machines can act on.

## 🧠 How I Think: Agentic & Security-First Engineering

I approach security engineering the same way modern AI systems operate:

* 🔁 **Ingest everything via APIs** (no UI dependency)
* 🧠 **Normalize signals into schemas agents can reason over**
* 🎯 **Prioritize exposure and persistence, not noise**
* 🔐 **Enforce identity-first, least-privilege access**
* 📉 **Design for cost control and operational efficiency**
* 🛡️ **Apply OWASP AI Top 10 controls directly to ML pipelines**


Security should **not** rely on:

* Manual exports
* Static dashboards
* One-off reports

> **Goal:** Build **self-directing security systems** that continuously assess risk and recommend (or execute) action.

## 🧱 What I Build

* ✅ Agentic vulnerability management platforms
* ✅ API-driven security ingestion pipelines
* ✅ JSON-first security schemas (not PDFs)
* ✅ Autonomous risk prioritization logic
* ✅ Identity-aware, cloud-native security workflows
* ✅ AI agents that explain *why* something matters — not just *that* it exists

I specialize in **bridging traditional security tools with modern AI workflows**.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🛡️ **Agentic Vulnerability Management System**

**(Tenable + Exposure-Aware Risk Reasoning)**

🔗 **Repo:**
👉 [https://github.com/albe290/agentic-vulnerability-management-agent](https://github.com/albe290/agentic-vulnerability-management-agent)

**What it is:**
A **production-grade, API-driven vulnerability management platform** that transforms traditional scanning into an **autonomous, exposure-aware risk reasoning system**.

**What it does:**

1. Programmatically ingests **baseline, authenticated, and unauthenticated Tenable scans**
2. Normalizes findings into **canonical asset-aware schemas**
3. Correlates multiple scan perspectives to determine:

   * External exposure
   * Persistence across scans
   * Misconfiguration-driven risk
4. Applies **agentic reasoning logic** to:

   * Prioritize remediation
   * Generate executive-ready risk summaries
   * Eliminate CVSS-only decision making

**Why it matters:**
This project demonstrates how **traditional vulnerability tooling can be elevated into an intelligent security system** one that reasons about exposure, persistence, and business impact instead of producing static reports.

> **Dashboards are optional. PDFs are dead.
> Agents decide now.**

### 🔐 Cloud & Identity Security Troubleshooting (IAM + Databricks)

🔗 Repo:
👉 [https://github.com/albe290/healthcare-data-engineering-troubleshooting](https://github.com/albe290/healthcare-data-engineering-troubleshooting)

**Why it matters:**
Identity failures are **security failures**. This project demonstrates real-world troubleshooting of IAM trust relationships, permissions, and misconfigurations — skills directly transferable to **securing AI pipelines and agent-based systems**.

---

### ❤️ Security-Hardened Machine Learning (OWASP AI Top 10)

🔗 Repo:
👉 https://github.com/albe290/Heart-Disease-Prediction

**What it is:**
A **security-hardened machine learning system** built in a healthcare context and explicitly aligned with the **OWASP AI Top 10**, demonstrating how ML models can be designed with **integrity, transparency, and governance** from the start.

**What it demonstrates:**
- A01: Training data integrity validation and poisoning safeguards
- A03: Domain-aware input validation and adversarial input handling
- A04: Automation bias mitigation via decision-support framing
- A05: Model transparency using feature importance and audit-friendly metrics

**Why it matters:**
This project shows how ML systems can be treated as **security-relevant infrastructure**, not just predictive models — a foundation for AI-driven risk classification, explainability, and agent-based security decision-making.
